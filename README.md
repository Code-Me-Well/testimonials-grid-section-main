## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

### Screenshot

#### Desktop Design

![Sample of the desktop design I built](images/desktop-design.jpeg)

#### Mobile Design

I decided not to attach the mobile screenshot here since it is pretty much long so if you need to see it you can navigate to the [images directory](images/mobile-design.png) and it should be there.
